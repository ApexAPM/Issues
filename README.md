# 🧭 ApexAPM Issues Repository

Welcome to the **ApexAPM Issues Repository** — the central hub for reporting, tracking, and resolving issues across all **ApexAPM products and services**.

This repo exists to keep things transparent, organized, and efficient. Whether you’re a user running into a bug, or part of the Apex team managing reports, this is the place.

---

## 🧩 What This Repo Is For

This repository is used to:
- Report **bugs**, **errors**, or **unexpected behavior** in any ApexAPM product.
- Submit **feature requests** or **improvement ideas**.
- Track the **status** and **resolution** of open issues.
- Provide visibility into what’s being worked on and fixed.

## 🧠 Before You Open an Issue

Please check the following before submitting:
1. 🔍 **Search existing issues** — someone else might’ve already reported it.
2. 🧾 **Gather context** — logs, screenshots, environment details, or steps to reproduce.
3. 🛠️ **Check versions** — make sure you’re using the latest release.

If it’s a **security issue**, **do NOT open a public issue** — instead, email Koston directly at **contact@koston.uk**.
